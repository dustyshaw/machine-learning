    "However, we turn this basic equation into a probability:  \n",
    "$$ P = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(b_0 + b_1x)}}  $$\n",

    "By turning it into a probability, it is now a Sigmoid function.   \n",

    "To make Logistic Regressions more performant, we do a **Gradient Descent** on it. With the gradient descent, we nudge the weights $b_0$ and $b_1$ a little to see if the error goes up or down until it settles.  \n",
